==============

1.)
User page - The index page contains links to my resume page, my biography page,
        and my Github page. It also has an image of me working at Teradyne.

Resume page - Contains information about my education, coursework,
        professional work, skills, and activities. It also contains a link
        to a profile of me on the Teradyne website.

Biography - Contains a short description of myself along with an image of
        me visiting Angkor Wat, with a caption.


These three pages are composed of one html file each as well as a single css
file for the three. Many of the same styling rules are reused between
the three pages to make the pages seem more uniform.

To my knowledge, all aspects of the assignment have been correctly implemented.


2.) I did not collaborate with/discuss the assignment with anyone.

3.) I spent approximately 4 hours completing the assignment.
